An Android app to help with managing my personal account. It downloads stock/bond data via yfinance and webscraping of FRED. 
Features:
  - Single stock analysis (simulated performance given empirical distribution of historical data, via bootstrapping)
  - Analyse a mock portfolio to see how it would have performed vs. historical data with different asset ratios, rebal frequencies, deviation allowance to target ratios.
  - Yield curve view at different dates for easy comparison
